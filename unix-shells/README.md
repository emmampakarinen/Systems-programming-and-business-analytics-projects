### Unix shells

This folder contains two programs - a simple shell and a more comprehensive shell. Both shells are implemented in C programming language.

The basic shell is an interactive loop that repeatedly prints a prompt, parses input, executes the command specified on that line of input, 
and waits for the command to finish. The comprehensive shell has additional features such as support for batch mode, a shell path to locate 
executables, and built-in commands. The main objectives of the project are to learn how processes are created, destroyed, and managed, 
and gain exposure to the necessary functionality in shells.

The more comprehensive shell's, "wish.c", assignment instructions can be found from here: https://github.com/remzi-arpacidusseau/ostep-projects/tree/master/processes-shell
